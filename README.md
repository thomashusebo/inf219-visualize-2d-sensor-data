# Visualize live sensor data
This project is part of bachelor degree in Informatics, Data Science, at University of Bergen. 

## About the project
An ongoing collaboration between Department of Physics and Technology (IFT), Department of Earth Science, and Department of 
Mathematics at UiB are currently working on creating the second iteration of a fluid-flow-rig. The fluid-flow-rig is a 
physical tank used to study fluid flow and convection patterns.

Sensors will be placed on the fluid-flow-rig, providing real-time resistivity readings. Because of the number of 
sensors, frequency of data, and duration per intended fluid-flow-rig project, a visualization of the data is very 
useful. 

My project will provide the functionality that enables the user to inspect both the live data, and previous readings in
an ongoing project.
## Some challenges
#### Continous development
-   The physical model, the instrumentation, and my software are all developed simultaneously. 
    -   This require continuous communication throughout the project across different professions
    -   A clear definition of what my software should provide, independent of the state of the physical model and 
    instrumentation. 
    
#### Corona crisis
-   March 12. UiB closed as a response to the corona crisis. Due to the nature of the project, the lockdown 
of the university have had a major impact on progression of the project in the past months.

## Prototype
Before the corona lockdown, a prototype of the software where working (though with manually feeding input to a 
file-creator). The code for the protype is available [here](https://github.com/thomashusebo/inf219-visualize-2d-sensor-data/tree/prototype). 
However, the data and 
the file-creators are not included. For the curious, here is a [video of the prototype testing](https://vimeo.com/396326719)

## Current master 
- **12.06.20**: The app has a skeleton structure. Content from the prototype will be added to fill the specifications 
given by IFT.
