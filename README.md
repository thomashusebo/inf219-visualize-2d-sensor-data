# Visualize live sensor data
This project is part of bachelor degree in Informatics, Data Science, at University of Bergen. 

## About the project
An ongoing collaboration between Department of Physics and Technology, Department of Earth Science, and Department of 
Mathematics at UiB are currently working on creating the second iteration of a fluid-flow-rig. The fluid-flow-rig is a 
physical tank used to study fluid flow and convection patterns, mainly focusing on CO2 storage in geological reservoirs. 

Sensors will be placed on the fluid-flow-rig, providing real-time resistivity readings. Because of the number of 
sensors, frequency of data, and duration per intended fluid-flow-rig project, a visualization of the data is very 
useful. 

My project will provide the functionality that enables the user to inspect both the live data, and previous readings in
an ongoing project.
#### Some challenges
-   The physical model, the instrumentation, and my software are all developed simultaneously. 
    -   This require continuous communication throughout the project across different professions
    -   A clear definition of what my software should provide, independent of the state of the physical model and 
    instrumentation.
